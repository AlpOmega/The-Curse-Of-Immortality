finish working on json files, first start with sounds

2024-3-4:
    finished working on the game structure, now I should start with making everything done in json files so that my organization is the best

2024-3-5:
    some code, I stopped because of fear i guess? anyway, I have to make a new way of making classes, I will clean some assets too

2024-3-11:
    add some functionality, tested images, now I want to add button that would make you start with the game Speech, then the game Logic

2024-3-16:
    played and expremented with pictures, although it throws error at me like: TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable

2024-3-17:
    the problem was the naming, it replaced every draw() method in the paragrah which led to it assginng draw method to none, simply changed draw to show, and changed MainMenu to super so that it inhreates everthing from the game correctly
    
2024-3-18:
    Okay, so about that, I need to add functionality that is dynamic and static, understand that from gpt and Implement functionality

2024-3-19:
    not much... well I won't get any better at this situation, anyways: is_clicked does see if it's clicked in the desired pos or not, use it to Implement a button

2024-3-20:
    Implement an avatar, when I tried to make a placeholder for my player, I made captian class that would contain the player attribute
